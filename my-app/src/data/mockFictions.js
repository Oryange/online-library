Take this family adventure and discover intrigue, heroism, and--most of all—epic love. Craving HEAT by Adrienne Giordano - Maggie Kingston is a woman working in a man’s world…and doing a damn good job. Being Steele Ridge’s first female sheriff isn’t easy. Especially when your cousins are magnets for trouble. The Steeles do everything the hard way, but Maggie’s tougher than she looks. Nothing shakes this sheriff until her cousin brings one of his superstar players—and the accompanying media circus—to town. The press can’t get enough of the sexy quarterback. And neither can Maggie… Jayson Tucker devoted his whole career to the New York Knights. So when the team takes a rookie’s side over his after a locker room brawl, he takes refuge from the spotlight. Except reporters aren’t the only ones after him. Someone wants Jayson benched. Permanently. When the threat becomes deadly, hiding won’t be enough. And in Steele Ridge, security comes in the luscious form of its gorgeous, no-nonsense sheriff. Jayson’s always fought his own battles. The closer he gets to Maggie, the less he’s willing to risk her being caught in the crossfire. Yet Maggie is no damsel in distress. She’s more than capable of keeping her town—and her man—safe. But can she say the same about her heart? Tasting FIRE by Kelsey Browning - Fire in one hand, ashes in the other Studious tutor Emmy McKay fell in love with Cash Kingston over a biology textbook, never expecting the high school football hero to give her a second thought. But his feelings for her burned just as hot. All too soon, Emmy’s choices destroyed their youthful relationship, reducing it to a pile of ash. Years later, she has landed her dream job as an ER doctor in her hometown. Now it’s time to win back her dream man. As a firefighter and tactical medic, Cash Kingston is no stranger to white-knuckle situations. But when he learns his beautiful—and brilliant—ex-girlfriend has returned to Steele Ridge, he feels as if he’s standing on the roof of a blazing building. With no escape route in sight. Emmy is the only woman who’s ever had the power to build him up one minute and burn him down the next. But when someone targets Emmy and they begin to suspect the danger stems from their past relationship, it’s impossible for Cash to stay detached. Will the struggle to untangle a web of half-truths bring them closer together, or will it tear them apart for good? Searing NEED by Tracey Devlyn - To escape a brutal killer, a brilliant researcher teams up with a tortured soldier who poses an even greater threat... to her heart. Her sister might be the law and her brothers the brawn, but Riley Kingston is definitely the brains of the family. She’s a talented botanist well on her way to a PhD—so why does she feel like a failure? Fired from a dream project in Costa Rica, Riley’s stuck back in her hometown. Cataloguing plants on Steele land keeps her busy, but it’s far from compelling work. Until she discovers a fascinating new specimen. One with a body made for pleasure . . . and eyes filled with a pain she longs to understand. Delta Force operator Coen Monroe doesn’t want to be studied. Not even by the sexy scientist whose inquisitive glances stir up desires he isn’t ready to handle. He came to Steele Ridge to be alone, to battle his nightmares and the memories triggering them. But Riley’s gentle seduction is as relentless as her curiosity. She soothes his wounded soul . . . and fires up his defensive instincts. But when her research sparks a deadly conspiracy, Coen is exactly what she needs. When Riley is targeted by a sociopath bent on silencing her forever, Coen will do anything to protect her. But can he save the woman he loves without losing himself in the process? Although all books are stand alones, if you would like to read the entire Steele Ridge series chronologically, the following is the correct order: The Beginning - The Steeles Going Hard - The Steeles Living Fast - The Steeles Loving Deep - The Steeles Breaking Free - The Steeles Roaming Wild - The Steeles Stripping Bare - The Steeles Enduring Love - The Steeles Craving Heat - The Kingstons Tasting Fire - The Kingstons Searing Need - The Kingstons Vowing Love - The Steeles Striking Edge - The Kingstons Burning Ache - The Kingstons",

Death at Wentwater Court: In early 1923, the young Honourable Daisy Dalrymple has made a decision that shocks her social class—she's decided to make her own living as a writer. Landing an assignment to write a series of articles on country manor houses, Daisy travels to Wentwater Court to research her first piece. There she finds a household in turmoil, filled with holiday guests and recriminations. But that's nothing compared to the uproar when one of those guests turns up dead in an \"accident.\" The Winter Garden Mystery: Continuing her assignment on country manor houses, Daisy travels to gloomy Occles Hall, which is under the charge of the autocratic Lady Valeria. While touring the gardens, Daisy discovers the body of a parlor maid that had gone missing two months prior. Distressed by the ineptitude of the local police force, Daisy plunges in to help find the killer before he strikes again. Requiem for a Mezzo: Back in London, Daisy attends a performance of Verdi's \"Requiem.\" During the show, the lead soprano keels over dead of an apparent poisoning. Joining Daisy in figuring out what happened is Scotland Yard Detective Inspector Alec Fletcher. The two embark on finding who wanted the singer dead, and why.",

Mas quando Arlena Stuart passa por ele na praia, atraindo o olhar de todos os homens (bem como o ódio de todas as mulheres), ele desconfia que talvez suas férias não sejam tão tranquilas como esperava. De fato, no dia seguinte, um assassinato acontece. Enquanto tenta descobrir quem é o responsável, Poirot percebe que não são poucas as pessoas naquele hotel que teriam um motivo para matar... Neste livro, o leitor é convidado a analisar junto com Poirot os motivos e os álibis de todos os hóspedes do Jolly Roger. Morte na praia é um quebra-cabeça complexo, ao melhor estilo de Agatha Christie.",

          "description": "Nascida em uma família de elite em um dos mais ricos setores da República, June é uma garota prodígio de 15 anos que está sendo preparada para o sucesso nos mais altos círculos militares da República; nascido nas favelas, Day, aos 15 anos, é o criminoso mais procurado do país. De mundos diferentes, suas vidas dificilmente se cruzariam, até que o irmão de June é assassinado e Day se torna o principal suspeito. Presos num grande jogo de gato e rato, Day luta pela sobrevivência da sua família, enquanto June procura vingar a morte de Metias. Mas, em uma chocante reviravolta, os dois descobrem a verdade sobre o que realmente os uniu e sobre até onde seu país irá para manter seus segredos. Publicada em mais de 24 países, a trilogia Legend, composta pelos volumes Legend, Prodigy e Champion, agora disponível num box exclusivo, é considerada por público e crítica uma das melhores do gênero, ao lado de outras como Jogos Vorazes e Divergente, e seus direitos de adaptação para o cinema foram vendidos para a CBS Films e a Temple Hill Entertainment. A saga se passa em um futuro distópico, na República da América, nação onde hoje se encontra a Costa Oeste dos Estados Unidos, devastada por desastres naturais e em constante guerra contra as Colônias (atual Costa Leste dos EUA). É neste contexto em que acontece o improvável encontro entre os jovens Day e June, o criminoso mais procurado do país e a menina-prodígio da República, que tem no exército seu principal defensor e, ao mesmo tempo, opressor. Chinesa radicada nos EUA desde os cinco anos, a autora Marie Lu viu os tanques de guerra a caminho da Praça da Paz Celestial, que ficava a algumas quadras de sua casa, em 1989. Não à toa, sua trilogia possui forte conteúdo político, em meio a uma trama repleta de ação, romance e reviravoltas.",
